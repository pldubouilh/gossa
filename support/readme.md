the master branch is automatically built and pushed to [dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/r/pldubouilh/gossa) under `pldubouilh/gossa`.

```sh
# pull from dockerhub and run
% sudo docker run -v ~/LocalDirToShare:/shared -p 8001:8001 pldubouilh/gossa
```

if you prefer building the image yourself :

```sh
# build gossa within a build container, needs to be ran within the sources, ../ from here, and run
% docker build -t gossa -f support/build.Dockerfile .
% sudo docker run -v ~/LocalDirToShare:/shared -p 8001:8001 gossa
```

the options are settable through environment variables that can be passed starting off the docker image.

a fancy docker image using [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com/) is also provided. have a look at the simple config file `Caddyfile`, it shows how to use http basic authentication, and automatic TLS for hands-free https ðŸŽ‰

```sh
# pull caddy-gossa image from dockerhub and run
% sudo docker run -v ~/LocalDirToShare:/shared -v `pwd`/Caddyfile:/Caddyfile --net=host pldubouilh/gossa:caddy
```

a docker-compose example image is also provided. running docker compose should be straightforward : `docker-compose up .` have a look in `docker-compose.yml` for further configuration.
